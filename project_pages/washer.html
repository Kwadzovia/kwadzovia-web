          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of my favourite projects. It was for an embedded systems
            course, where we were given multiple different project options. My
            partner and I chose to work with the washing machine because it was
            an interesting mix of electronic hardware and firmware, all with an
            external interface. The brain of the operation was a TM4C123GH6PM
            MCU, which interfaced with the hardware using a ribbon cable.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project began at the very start of COVID-19, meaning that we
            quickly learned that we would not be able to work on it together in
            person. We decided that my partner would keep the board, and handle
            the hardware. We frequently met up remotely to discuss hardware
            debugging and board-bringup. It was the first time that I had
            written code for an embedded system that I could not test in person,
            which was fairly challenging.

          <h3>System Information</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="image left"
              ><img src="../images/washer_board.jpg" alt=""
            /></span>
            The board itself was a washing machine simulator made by Bytronic.
            There was no internal logic, but it thankfully contained all the
            necessary Motor driver, Latch, and switch circuitry. One of the most
            difficult parts of the bringup procedure was determining which pins
            to connect between the header and the microcontroller since the
            documentation was extremely vague on what pin number controlled what
            part of the board. It took a bit of trial and error but eventually,
            a pin pattern was found.
          </p>
          The washing machine behaviour was relatively well defined before we
          started. Six different wash cycles could be selected using the button
          to LED interface: Whites, Colours, Mixed, Economy, Delicates, and
          Heavy Load. Each mode would require a different temperature, wash
          speed, and time. This was described in detail in our documentation.
          There were 10 checkpoints that each option would go through: Fill,
          Heat, Wash, Empty, Fill, Rinse, Empty, Spin, Dry, Complete. Lastly,
          the buzzer would sound whenever the door was opened during the cycle
          using interrupts.

          <p>
            <span class="image right"
              ><img src="../images/washer_pinout.png" alt=""
            /></span>
            We used excel to determine which pins would be used for each
            peripheral on our microcontroller. There were switches, motors and
            encoders, 7-segments, and three different colour LEDs. We handled
            timers in software using the MCU peripherals.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was probably my favourite project in my program. It was the
            first time I developed firmware for a system this complex, and it
            went extremely well considering the setbacks we faced at the start
            of the pandemic. If you're up for it, there's a fully documented
            report on the setup on my Github Page.
